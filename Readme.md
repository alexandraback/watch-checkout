Application is built in a multi staged docker build 
and hence can be both build and run by running from root folder.
```bash
docker build -t app .
```

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Run
Docker compose is used for spinning up the db (Postgresql) and spring boot app.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \                                                                                          7 â†µ
